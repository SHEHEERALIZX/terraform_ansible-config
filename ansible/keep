To fix this error on Amazon Linux 2, you can try the following steps:

Verify that the system is connected to the internet by running the command ping google.com.
Run the command sudo yum update to update the package information on the system.
Try to install the epel-release package by running the command sudo yum install epel-release.
If the above steps don't work, you can try adding the EPEL repository manually by creating a file called epel.repo in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory and adding the following lines:

[epel]
name=Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 7 - $basearch
baseurl=https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7
